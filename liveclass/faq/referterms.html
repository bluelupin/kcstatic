                <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, We are not in the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</p>
                <P>As already described in our terms and condition , we do not collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 and children under 13 may not register as users of the Services. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. We do, however, collect information about children from their parents or guardians who are registered users of the Services and we treat such information as “Personal Information” under this Privacy Policy. We ask that our users not provide information about a child without first obtaining consent from that child’s parent or guardian (“Parental Consent”). If we learn we have collected personal information directly from a child under 13 or about a child without Parental Consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information or that information about a child was provided without Parental Consent, please contact us at info@kidschaupal.com.</P>

                <b class="termServiceTxt">Change in Privacy Policy.</b>
                <p>KIDSCHAUPAL constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change the Privacy Policy on the basis of any services change from time to time as well, but we will inform you to changes by placing a notice on the KIDSCHAUPAL website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.</p>
                <p>Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Information Collection</b>
                <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, children’s birthday(s) and gender, biography, home city, and your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
                <p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you marketing emails, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If we do email you, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us at info@kidschaupal.com</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Information Collected Automatically</b>
                <p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p>
                <p>Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Location Information</b>
                <p>The Services provide location-based information, so in order to work, the Services need to know your location. You will be asked for access to geo-location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system or browser. Whenever you open and use/interact with our apps on your mobile device or go to one of our Sites, we automatically receive and use the precise location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Services to your current location (i.e., we’ll show you a list of nearby places and stories). This information is NOT shared with others.</p>
                <p>Your real-time location is not shared on the app. If you write a story, scout, bookmark, like or otherwise provide content, users may infer that you have been to that location. Some content, like stories, may be time stamped and other users could use that information to infer when you were at a place. However, note that stories can be posted when you aren’t at the place featured in your story.</p>
                <p>Each of your stories using the Services is saved to your “Profile” which allows users to look back at all the locations you have interacted with since you created your Services account. You can delete any or all of your stories from your Profile page in the app.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Sharing of the Personal Information .</b>
                <p>We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone, except as expressly provided below. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>
                <p>Information that’s been de-identified. We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Advertisers</b>
                <p>We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in Bangalore to show you ads or offers for Banglore businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Associated Businesses and Partners</b>
                <p>In certain situations, associated businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an associated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that business partners only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an associated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>

                <b class="termServiceTxt">User Profiles and Submissions</b>

Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments.</p>

                <b class="termServiceTxt">Protection of Personal Information.</b>

            <h3>Content Guidelines</h3>
            <ol style="padding:0px; margin:0px;">
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Violence and Threats</b>
                <p>Safety is Kidschaupal top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity are not allowed to maintain a presence on our Site. We also prohibit promoting, planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Self-Harm</b>
                <p>Kidschaupal takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for people in distress.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Bullying and Harassment</b>
                <p>Kidschuapl does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Hate Speech</b>
                <p>Kidschaupal does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions, events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Graphic Content</b>
                <p>Kidschaupal Sites provide a place where people turn to share their experiences and raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our Site.</p>
                <p>When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch it.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Nudity and Pornography</b>
                <p>Kidschaupal has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo’s David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Identity and Privacy</b>
                <p>On Kidschaupal Sites people connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent. Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Kidschaupal terms.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Intellectual Property</b>

              </li>
              <li>
                <b class="termServiceTxt">Phishing and Spam</b>
                <p>We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to compromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by not contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.</p>
